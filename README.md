# Workforce Analytics Insights – EDA, PCA, KMeans & A/B Testing

An end-to-end workforce analytics project combining **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **KMeans clustering**, and **A/B testing** to derive actionable insights into employee training, performance, engagement, and program effectiveness.

---

## Approach
1. **EDA** – Analyzed demographics, training participation, assessment outcomes, and regional trends.
2. **PCA** – Reduced dimensionality to 3 key performance components.
3. **KMeans Clustering** – Segmented employees into data-driven clusters for targeted interventions.
4. **A/B Testing** – Measured the effectiveness of new training curricula in experimental cities against control groups.
5. **Interactive Dashboard** – Built a Streamlit app for visual exploration and stakeholder insights. (https://workforce-analytics-dashboard.streamlit.app)
