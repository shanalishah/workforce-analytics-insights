# Workforce Analytics Insights – EDA, PCA & KMeans
End-to-end workforce analytics project applying **EDA**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, and **KMeans clustering** to uncover patterns in employee training, performance, engagement, and geographic distribution.

## Overview
Analyzes workforce datasets from multiple sources to reveal trends, identify key performance drivers, segment employees into actionable groups, and provide insights for targeted interventions.  

**Approach:**  
1. **EDA** – demographics, training participation, assessment outcomes, and regional trends  
2. **PCA** – reduced dimensionality to 3 key performance components  
3. **KMeans** – created data-driven employee clusters  
4. **Dashboard** – interactive Streamlit app for visual exploration
